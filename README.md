# Teaching-Myself---p5.js

## Why P5.js? 
* I chose to work with p5.js because I’m curious about creating custom images and animations to add to my pages. I was fascinated by the idea of ‘sketching’ with code and p5.js allows me to to do just that. 


## What problem does it solve?, How does it solve the problem? (conceptually)
* P5.js incorporates the idea of ‘sketching’ to allow users to create interactive graphics with code. The official site says: “The idea is to write a single line of code, and have a circle show up on the screen. Add a few more lines of code, and the circle follows the mouse. Another line of code, and the circle changes color when the mouse is pressed.”


## Why should people use it? What are the alternatives? 
* The alternative  to using p5 is to learn algorithms necessary to create shapes and animations. This route requires significantly more time. 


## What is the history of this technology? Who built it and why? Who is maintaining it? 
* “Processing” was a project started in 2001 by Casey Reiss(sp) and Ben Fry, who were artists, designers and coders who wanted a tool that could help them with their own work. Since then, “creative expression” through programming has been a popular goal for developers. p5.js was created by Lauren McCarthy as a JavaScript solution to creative expression on the web. 

## What is your opinion of the technology after having built something? 
* Using p5.js is fun! If I can sketch an image by hand, there's probably a way to replicate that sketch in p5. I like the flexibility that the p5's 'sketching' provides. 


## What are the biggest conceptual hurdles you encountered when researching this? 
* Listing several canvases on a single page was my greatese conceptual hurdle for this project. I was specifically trying to include canvas examples involving mouse events, so it took some research to figure out that I needed to use 'Instance mode.' The next hurdle was figuring out exactly how to do that (with correct syntax).  


## What resources do you recommend for interested students? 
* The p5.js official site has some great resources of its own.  The ‘p5js.org/reference’ page explains every code element with a description and examples. Additionally, the ‘examples’ page shows some examples of these elements in use. 


## What are 3 interview questions one might be asked about this technology? 
* What are some of the advantages of using p5.js? 
* What is the difference between Global mode and Instance mode?
